A Home Assistant custom integration for INIM alarm systems (SmartLiving, Prime, etc.) via INIM Cloud, with optional local real-time updates.

## Fork status

This repository is a personal fork of [`pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm`](https://github.com/pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm).

It is based on upstream `pla10/main` commit:

```text
b031020de236017417002f63242766b30560cf73
```

The goal of this fork is to test and submit improvements upstream while keeping a working version for local INIM Prime / Home Assistant / HomeKit use.

### Changes developed in this fork / submitted upstream

- [PR #15](https://github.com/pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm/pull/15) — **Support INIM double-zone SIA-IP mapping**
  - Adds support for INIM double-zone / secondary-channel SIA-IP mappings.
  - Keeps the existing exact `ZoneId` match first, then tries fallback candidates for double-zone events.
  - Tested with standard and double-zone SIA-IP events such as `BA1`, `BR1`, `BA20`, `BR20`, `BA2002`, `BR2002`, etc.

- [PR #17](https://github.com/pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm/pull/17) — **Stabilize alarm area states after scenario changes**
  - Improves area state handling after scenario changes from Home Assistant/HomeKit, INIM app, SIA-IP, or WebSocket.
  - Applies expected area states from scenario `AreaSet` after HA scenario commands.
  - Detects external `ActiveScenario` changes from cloud polling.
  - Ignores stale realtime area updates that contradict a recent scenario state.
  - Debounces SIA/WebSocket area `Armed` updates so Home Assistant receives one stable state instead of partial area-by-area transitions.
  - Infers `armed_home` / `armed_away` from the active configured scenario.

- [PR #18](https://github.com/pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm/pull/18) — **Add per-zone alarm memory binary sensors**
  - Adds a second binary sensor for each visible alarm zone to expose the zone `AlarmMemory` flag as a real entity.
  - Keeps the normal zone open/closed binary sensors unchanged.
  - Creates entities named `Allarme <zone name>` for per-zone alarm memory.
  - Useful for dashboards, automations, and HomeKit Bridge setups that need to know exactly which zone caused an alarm.
  - Skips output/relay-style zones where possible.

- [PR #19](https://github.com/pla10/homeassistant_inim_alarm/pull/19) — **Add configurable zone alarm memory exposure modes**
  - Adds `zone_alarm_memory_exposure` integration option.
  - Available modes: `Disabled`, `Safety binary sensors`, `Read-only alarm panels`, `Both`.
  - Adds optional read-only per-zone `alarm_control_panel` entities backed by `AlarmMemory`.
  - Read-only alarm panels expose `AlarmMemory == false` as `disarmed` and `AlarmMemory == true` as `triggered`.
  - Intended especially for HomeKit, where alarm panel entities produce security-style important notifications with the zone name.
  - Adds `excluded_alarm_memory_zones` so users can manually exclude relays, outputs, lights, heating, door-release outputs, or any other zones they do not want exposed as alarm memory entities.

> Note: some changes may live on feature branches until they are merged upstream or into this fork's `main` branch.

## 📡 Real-Time Updates

The integration supports three communication channels for maximum reliability and speed:

| Channel | Latency | Direction | Use Case |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **REST API** (polling) | ~35s | HA → Cloud → Panel | Full state refresh (fallback) |
| **WebSocket** (cloud push) | 1-3s | Panel → Cloud → HA | Alarm events, arming/disarming |
| **SIA-IP** (local push) | < 1s | Panel → HA (direct LAN) | Zone open/close, tamper, burglar alarm |

- **WebSocket** is always active and provides near-instant notifications for alarm-critical events (sirens, arming state changes) via INIM Cloud.
- **SIA-IP** is an optional local listener that receives SIA-DC09 messages directly from the panel over your LAN — no cloud dependency, sub-second latency for all sensor events.
- **Polling** acts as a safety net to reconcile state. When SIA-IP is enabled, polling is automatically reduced to every 5 minutes.

## 📋 Supported Devices

This integration works with INIM alarm panels connected to INIM Cloud:

- SmartLiving series (515, 1050, 10100, etc.)
- Prime series
- Other INIM panels compatible with the Inim Home app

## 📦 Prerequisites

1. An INIM alarm system registered on INIM Cloud
2. The **Inim Home** app credentials (email and password)
3. Your alarm **User Code** (the PIN you use to arm/disarm)
4. Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or newer

## 🚀 Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu (⋮) → "Custom repositories"
4. Add repository URL: `https://github.com/sadspamxxx/homeassistant_inim_alarm`
5. Select category: "Integration" → Click "Add"
6. Search for "INIM Alarm" and click "Download"
7. Restart Home Assistant
8. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **+ Add Integration** → Search "INIM Alarm"

### Manual Installation

1. Download this repository or the branch you want to test
2. Copy the contents of `custom_components/inim_alarm/` to `config/custom_components/inim_alarm/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "INIM Alarm"
4. Enter:
   - **Email** - Your INIM Cloud email (same as Inim Home app)
   - **Password** - Your INIM Cloud password
   - **User Code** - Your alarm PIN code (required for arm/disarm)

### Options (After Setup)

Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **INIM Alarm** → **Configure**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Polling Interval** | How often to poll for full state update (10-300s) | 30s (300s if SIA-IP enabled) |
| **Enable SIA-IP** | Enable local SIA-IP TCP listener | Off |
| **SIA-IP Port** | TCP port for SIA-IP listener | 6001 |
| **SIA Account ID** | Filter by SIA account (leave empty for all) | Empty |

### SIA-IP Setup (Optional)

SIA-IP provides the fastest updates by receiving events directly from the panel over your local network. This requires configuration on the INIM panel by your installer:

1. **On the INIM panel** (via installer or SmartLeague software):
   - Enable SIA-IP reporting on the SmartLAN/SI module
   - Set the **Home Assistant IP address** as the receiving center
   - Set the **port** (default: 6001)
   - Protocol: SIA-DC09 over TCP
2. **In Home Assistant**:
   - Go to integration options
   - Enable **SIA-IP listener**
   - Set the same **port** configured on the panel
   - Optionally set the **SIA Account ID** to filter messages

> **Note:** SIA-IP requires your HA instance to be reachable from the panel on the configured port. Make sure your firewall allows incoming TCP connections on that port.

## 🔢 Lovelace Keypad

To show a keypad on the alarm panel card (for UI security), use:

```yaml
type: alarm-panel
entity: alarm_control_panel.your_alarm
states:
  - arm_away
require_code: true  # Shows numeric keypad
```

> **Note:** The keypad code is managed by Lovelace, not the integration.
> You can set any code you want for the UI - it doesn't need to match your alarm code.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Credentials stay local** - Stored encrypted in Home Assistant only
- **No third-party servers** - Direct communication with INIM Cloud only
- **No credential logging** - Passwords/tokens never in logs
- **HTTPS only** - All cloud communication encrypted
- **SIA-IP local only** - Local listener never leaves your LAN
- **Scenario buttons disabled by default** - No accidental arm/disarm without PIN

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect
- Verify credentials work in Inim Home app
- Check internet connection

### Entities not updating
- Check polling interval in options
- WebSocket updates should appear in debug logs
- If using SIA-IP, verify the panel can reach HA on the configured port
- Enable debug logging (see below)

### Arm/Disarm not working
- Delete and re-add the integration
- Make sure to enter the user code during setup

### SIA-IP not receiving events
- Verify the panel is configured to send SIA-IP events to your HA IP
- Check that the port matches on both sides
- Ensure no firewall is blocking incoming TCP connections
- Check debug logs for "SIA-IP" messages

### Debug Logging
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.inim_alarm: debug
```
